## Use Cases

### Cross OS Benchmark

Although ESBench has a built-in toolchains and parameters as variables, this is not all factors in the performance of a function. For external environments, we provide `--tag` CLI argument to add additional variables.

The GitHub Actions example to show how to run benchmarks on different OS and merge the results into the single table:

```yaml
name: Cross OS Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  # First run the benchmarks in 3 operating systems.
  run:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, windows-latest, ubuntu-latest]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    steps:
      # Initialize repository
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: latest
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: latest
          run_install: true

      # Use --tag argument to add the OS name to result.
      - run: pnpm exec esbench --tag os:${{ matrix.os }}

      # Upload the result file to Actions Artifacts
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: result-${{ matrix.os }}

          # This is the default path of Raw Reporter.
          path: node_modules/.esbench/result.json

  # Start a Job to generate the report.
  report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Should run after all the benchmarks finished.
    needs: run

    steps:
      # Initialize repository
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: latest
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: latest
          run_install: true

      # Download result files from Actions Artifacts.
      # Filename is like:
      #   reports/result-${{ matrix.os }}/result.json
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          path: reports
          pattern: result-*

      # Use the report command to collect all results
      - run: pnpm exec esbench report reports/**/*.json
```
